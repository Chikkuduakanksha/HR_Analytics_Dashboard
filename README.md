# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

"Excited to share the latest data visualization I've created as a data analyst using HR data! üìäüë©‚Äçüíº

As HR data becomes more readily available, it's important to find ways to make sense of the information and extract meaningful insights. In this project, I used my skills in data analysis and visualization to create an engaging dashboard that allows for easy interpretation of the data.

The dashboard I've created provides a comprehensive overview of the HR metrics that matter most to organizations, including employee turnover, retention, and recruitment. By analyzing this data, I was able to identify patterns and trends that provide valuable insights for decision-making.

The visualizations I've created use a combination of charts and graphs that are easy to read and understand. They help to illustrate key findings, such as the impact of training and development programs on employee retention rates and the effectiveness of various recruitment strategies.
